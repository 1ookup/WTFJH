This is a fork of dumpdecrypted by *CarinaTT*

Was about to do the dirty work myself until i saw this. Thanks for saving me quite some time >_<

I've compared dumped binary from WTFJH's dumpdecrypted and Clutch. Seems like CodeSignature is messed up in this one. But decrypting will invalidate CS anyway so it doesn't really matter.
